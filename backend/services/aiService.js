- For HIGH RISK clauses: highlight serious issues requiring immediate attention
- Identifies potential risks and their implications
- Provides actionable recommendations for all clauses
- Considers industry standards and best practices
- Highlights both positive and negative aspects
- Suggests specific negotiation points where applicable
- Shows the complete picture of the document, not just problems`;
